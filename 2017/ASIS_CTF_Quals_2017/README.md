# ASIS CTF Quals 2017

This CTF was going on concurrently with Pico CTF, so we didn't get much time look at it as we were focusing on Pico.
However, we still ranked 100th out of 451 teams. This CTF had many interesting crypto problems.

## Problems

* [A Fine OTP Server (79/Crypto)](problems/A_Fine_OTP_Server/A_Fine_OTP_Server.md)
* [DLP (158/Crypto)](problems/DLP/DLP.md)

## Test latex

$$ed_p - 1 = 0\pmod{p-1}$$, meaning that $$ed_p - 1$$ evenly divides $$p-1$$
