At first glance, this problem can be very confusing. However, the solution is actually very simple. Searching `"or LPT, LPT-D, what else can you kludge for tipping… cough…"`(with quotes) gives us [this file](https://www.aclu.org/files/natsec/nsa/the-nsa-and-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics.pdf).

Ctrl-F any phrase such as "tipping" or "kludge" and we find the flag.
