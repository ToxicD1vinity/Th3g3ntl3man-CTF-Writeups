Problem Statement:
Binary 1

Why doesnâ€™t [this file](a.out) print!! Did I forget to put in the print statement when I compiled?

Hint:

Well running it does nothing, maybe try looking inside?

As with all very low-point value reversing problems, we can simply run strings on the file and get the flag:
```
$ strings a.out | grep "flag"
flag_1297831859
```

Flag
------

`flag_1297831859`
