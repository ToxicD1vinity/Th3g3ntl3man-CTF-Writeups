Problem Statement:
Yatharth just dropped his fire new mixtape, but the last track is somewhat of a mystery. It’s called ‘See the Sound,’ and no one really knows what to make of it.

[seethesound.wav](see_the_sound.wav)

Hint:

Look at it!

Based on the description and the hint, we have to somehow 'visualize' the sound file.

To do this, we can open up the file in [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/), and view the audio file as a spectrogram (click on the file name, then click 'Spectrogram'), which gives us the message: `Congratulations. The flag is: just_like_batman`
