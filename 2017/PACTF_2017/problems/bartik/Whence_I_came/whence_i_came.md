Open Sourcery

Look from where I came! The key is somewhere in there… or at least it’d like to be!

Hint:

I am the creation of open sourcery!

The problem suggests looking at open source material. The first thing that comes to mind when 'open source' is mentioned is github.

Searching "pactf github" gives us [this link](https://github.com/PACTF/pactf), which is the github for PACTF. Looking at the files, `ctfproblems/NOT_THE_SOLUTIONS.md` stands out with the commit message "YES THIS IS A FLAG!"

Opening it up, we see the flag.
