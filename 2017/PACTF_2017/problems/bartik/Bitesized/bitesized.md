Problem Statement:
Thereâ€™s an image of some trees here. I bet the image contains more than trees, though. [trees.png](https://github.com/hgarrereyn/Th3g3ntl3man-CTF-Writeups/raw/66038b5e3e96aff65fa07ddfe5c1fb1abfa2f61a/2017/PACTF_2017/problems/bartik/Bitesized/trees.png)

This problem was fairly simple, all you had to do was run [stegsolve](http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar) on it and we get the flag.
