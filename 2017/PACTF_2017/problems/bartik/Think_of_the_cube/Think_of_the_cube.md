Problem Statement:
Get Cubed

I found this floating around on a piece of paper while geocaching. What could “dqow_UrrEcxbaDdfgwwIhww” possibly mean?

Hint:

What are some weird ciphers? Maybe originally involving a cube?

It looks like the flag was encoded using some sort of cube cipher. Googling `cube cipher` gives us the trifid cipher.

We can use an online decoder to get the flag. I used [this](http://www.geocachingtoolbox.com/index.php?page=trifidCipher) website, and the key is simply the default cube.
