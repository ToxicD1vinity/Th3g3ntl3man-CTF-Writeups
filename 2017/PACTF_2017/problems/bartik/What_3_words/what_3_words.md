In this problem, we are given several strings of three seemingly unrelated words delimited by periods. Looking at the hint, we have to find some sort of map to decipher the message.

Googling "what 3 words map" gives us [this](https://map.what3words.com/).

Using this, we can enter each string to decode the problem statement. It ends up becoming: `Well done! Flagg is Longyearbyen.`
